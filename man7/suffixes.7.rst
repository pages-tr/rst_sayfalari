NAME
====

suffixes - list of file suffixes

DESCRIPTION
===========

It is customary to indicate the contents of a file with the file suffix,
which (typically) consists of a period, followed by one or more letters.
Many standard utilities, such as compilers, use this to recognize the
type of file they are dealing with. The **make**\ (1) utility is driven
by rules based on file suffix.

Following is a list of suffixes which are likely to be found on a Linux
system.
