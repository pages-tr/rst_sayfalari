namespaces - overview of Linux namespaces

DESCRIPTION
===========

A namespace wraps a global system resource in an abstraction that makes
it appear to the processes within the namespace that they have their own
isolated instance of the global resource. Changes to the global resource
are visible to other processes that are members of the namespace, but
are invisible to other processes. One use of namespaces is to implement
containers.

This page provides pointers to information on the various namespace
types, describes the associated */proc* files, and summarizes the APIs
for working with namespaces.

Namespace types
---------------

The following table shows the namespace types available on Linux. The
second column of the table shows the flag value that is used to specify
the namespace type in various APIs. The third column identifies the
manual page that provides details on the namespace type. The last column
is a summary of the resources that are isolated by the namespace type.

The namespaces API
------------------

As well as various */proc* files described below, the namespaces API
includes the following system calls:

**clone**\ (2)
   The **clone**\ (2) system call creates a new process. If the *flags*
   argument of the call specifies one or more of the **CLONE_NEW\***
   flags listed below, then new namespaces are created for each flag,
   and the child process is made a member of those namespaces. (This
   system call also implements a number of features unrelated to
   namespaces.)

**setns**\ (2)
   The **setns**\ (2) system call allows the calling process to join an
   existing namespace. The namespace to join is specified via a file
   descriptor that refers to one of the */proc/[pid]/ns* files described
   below.

**unshare**\ (2)
   The **unshare**\ (2) system call moves the calling process to a new
   namespace. If the *flags* argument of the call specifies one or more
   of the **CLONE_NEW\*** flags listed below, then new namespaces are
   created for each flag, and the calling process is made a member of
   those namespaces. (This system call also implements a number of
   features unrelated to namespaces.)

**ioctl**\ (2)
   Various **ioctl**\ (2) operations can be used to discover information
   about namespaces. These operations are described in
   **ioctl_ns**\ (2).

Creation of new namespaces using **clone**\ (2) and **unshare**\ (2) in
most cases requires the **CAP_SYS_ADMIN** capability, since, in the new
namespace, the creator will have the power to change global resources
that are visible to other processes that are subsequently created in, or
join the namespace. User namespaces are the exception: since Linux 3.8,
no privilege is required to create a user namespace.

The /proc/[pid]/ns/ directory
-----------------------------

Each process has a */proc/[pid]/ns/* subdirectory containing one entry
for each namespace that supports being manipulated by **setns**\ (2):

::

   $ ls -l /proc/$$/ns | awk '{print $1, $9, $10, $11}'
   total 0
   lrwxrwxrwx. cgroup -> cgroup:[4026531835]
   lrwxrwxrwx. ipc -> ipc:[4026531839]
   lrwxrwxrwx. mnt -> mnt:[4026531840]
   lrwxrwxrwx. net -> net:[4026531969]
   lrwxrwxrwx. pid -> pid:[4026531836]
   lrwxrwxrwx. pid_for_children -> pid:[4026531834]
   lrwxrwxrwx. time -> time:[4026531834]
   lrwxrwxrwx. time_for_children -> time:[4026531834]
   lrwxrwxrwx. user -> user:[4026531837]
   lrwxrwxrwx. uts -> uts:[4026531838]

Bind mounting (see **mount**\ (2)) one of the files in this directory to
somewhere else in the filesystem keeps the corresponding namespace of
the process specified by *pid* alive even if all processes currently in
the namespace terminate.

Opening one of the files in this directory (or a file that is bind
mounted to one of these files) returns a file handle for the
corresponding namespace of the process specified by *pid*. As long as
this file descriptor remains open, the namespace will remain alive, even
if all processes in the namespace terminate. The file descriptor can be
passed to **setns**\ (2).

In Linux 3.7 and earlier, these files were visible as hard links. Since
Linux 3.8, they appear as symbolic links. If two processes are in the
same namespace, then the device IDs and inode numbers of their
*/proc/[pid]/ns/xxx* symbolic links will be the same; an application can
check this using the *stat.st_dev* and *stat.st_ino* fields returned by
**stat**\ (2). The content of this symbolic link is a string containing
the namespace type and inode number as in the following example:

::

   $ readlink /proc/$$/ns/uts
   uts:[4026531838]

The symbolic links in this subdirectory are as follows:

*/proc/[pid]/ns/cgroup* (since Linux 4.6)
   This file is a handle for the cgroup namespace of the process.

*/proc/[pid]/ns/ipc* (since Linux 3.0)
   This file is a handle for the IPC namespace of the process.

*/proc/[pid]/ns/mnt* (since Linux 3.8)
   This file is a handle for the mount namespace of the process.

*/proc/[pid]/ns/net* (since Linux 3.0)
   This file is a handle for the network namespace of the process.

*/proc/[pid]/ns/pid* (since Linux 3.8)
   This file is a handle for the PID namespace of the process. This
   handle is permanent for the lifetime of the process (i.e., a
   process's PID namespace membership never changes).

*/proc/[pid]/ns/pid_for_children* (since Linux 4.12)
   This file is a handle for the PID namespace of child processes
   created by this process. This can change as a consequence of calls to
   **unshare**\ (2) and **setns**\ (2) (see **pid_namespaces**\ (7)), so
   the file may differ from */proc/[pid]/ns/pid*. The symbolic link
   gains a value only after the first child process is created in the
   namespace. (Beforehand, **readlink**\ (2) of the symbolic link will
   return an empty buffer.)

*/proc/[pid]/ns/time* (since Linux 5.6)
   This file is a handle for the time namespace of the process.

*/proc/[pid]/ns/time_for_children* (since Linux 5.6)
   This file is a handle for the time namespace of child processes
   created by this process. This can change as a consequence of calls to
   **unshare**\ (2) and **setns**\ (2) (see **time_namespaces**\ (7)),
   so the file may differ from */proc/[pid]/ns/time*.

*/proc/[pid]/ns/user* (since Linux 3.8)
   This file is a handle for the user namespace of the process.

*/proc/[pid]/ns/uts* (since Linux 3.0)
   This file is a handle for the UTS namespace of the process.

Permission to dereference or read (**readlink**\ (2)) these symbolic
links is governed by a ptrace access mode **PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS**
check; see **ptrace**\ (2).

The /proc/sys/user directory
----------------------------

The files in the */proc/sys/user* directory (which is present since
Linux 4.9) expose limits on the number of namespaces of various types
that can be created. The files are as follows:

*max_cgroup_namespaces*
   The value in this file defines a per-user limit on the number of
   cgroup namespaces that may be created in the user namespace.

*max_ipc_namespaces*
   The value in this file defines a per-user limit on the number of ipc
   namespaces that may be created in the user namespace.

*max_mnt_namespaces*
   The value in this file defines a per-user limit on the number of
   mount namespaces that may be created in the user namespace.

*max_net_namespaces*
   The value in this file defines a per-user limit on the number of
   network namespaces that may be created in the user namespace.

*max_pid_namespaces*
   The value in this file defines a per-user limit on the number of PID
   namespaces that may be created in the user namespace.

*max_time_namespaces* (since Linux 5.7)
   The value in this file defines a per-user limit on the number of time
   namespaces that may be created in the user namespace.

*max_user_namespaces*
   The value in this file defines a per-user limit on the number of user
   namespaces that may be created in the user namespace.

*max_uts_namespaces*
   The value in this file defines a per-user limit on the number of uts
   namespaces that may be created in the user namespace.

Note the following details about these files:

-  The values in these files are modifiable by privileged processes.

-  The values exposed by these files are the limits for the user
   namespace in which the opening process resides.

-  The limits are per-user. Each user in the same user namespace can
   create namespaces up to the defined limit.

-  The limits apply to all users, including UID 0.

-  These limits apply in addition to any other per-namespace limits
   (such as those for PID and user namespaces) that may be enforced.

-  Upon encountering these limits, **clone**\ (2) and **unshare**\ (2)
   fail with the error **ENOSPC**.

-  For the initial user namespace, the default value in each of these
   files is half the limit on the number of threads that may be created
   (*/proc/sys/kernel/threads-max*). In all descendant user namespaces,
   the default value in each file is **MAXINT**.

-  When a namespace is created, the object is also accounted against
   ancestor namespaces. More precisely:

   -  Each user namespace has a creator UID.

   -  When a namespace is created, it is accounted against the creator
      UIDs in each of the ancestor user namespaces, and the kernel
      ensures that the corresponding namespace limit for the creator UID
      in the ancestor namespace is not exceeded.

   -  The aforementioned point ensures that creating a new user
      namespace cannot be used as a means to escape the limits in force
      in the current user namespace.

Namespace lifetime
------------------

Absent any other factors, a namespace is automatically torn down when
the last process in the namespace terminates or leaves the namespace.
However, there are a number of other factors that may pin a namespace
into existence even though it has no member processes. These factors
include the following:

-  An open file descriptor or a bind mount exists for the corresponding
   */proc/[pid]/ns/\** file.

-  The namespace is hierarchical (i.e., a PID or user namespace), and
   has a child namespace.

-  It is a user namespace that owns one or more nonuser namespaces.

-  It is a PID namespace, and there is a process that refers to the
   namespace via a */proc/[pid]/ns/pid_for_children* symbolic link.

-  It is an IPC namespace, and a corresponding mount of an *mqueue*
   filesystem (see **mq_overview**\ (7)) refers to this namespace.

-  It is a PID namespace, and a corresponding mount of a **proc**\ (5)
   filesystem refers to this namespace.
