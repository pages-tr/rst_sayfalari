NAME
====

socketpair - create a pair of connected sockets

SYNOPSIS
========

| **#include <sys/types.h>** /\* See NOTES \*/
| **#include <sys/socket.h>**

**int socketpair(int**\ *domain*\ **, int**\ *type*\ **,
int**\ *protocol*\ **",**\ *int*\ **"**\ *sv*\ **[2]);**

DESCRIPTION
===========

The **socketpair**\ () call creates an unnamed pair of connected sockets
in the specified *domain*, of the specified *type*, and using the
optionally specified *protocol*. For further details of these arguments,
see **socket**\ (2).

The file descriptors used in referencing the new sockets are returned in
*sv*\ [0] and *sv*\ [1]. The two sockets are indistinguishable.

RETURN VALUE
============

On success, zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned, *errno* is set
appropriately, and *sv* is left unchanged

On Linux (and other systems), **socketpair**\ () does not modify *sv* on
failure. A requirement standardizing this behavior was added in
POSIX.1-2008 TC2.

ERRORS
======

**EAFNOSUPPORT**
   The specified address family is not supported on this machine.

**EFAULT**
   The address *sv* does not specify a valid part of the process address
   space.

**EMFILE**
   The per-process limit on the number of open file descriptors has been
   reached.

**ENFILE**
   The system-wide limit on the total number of open files has been
   reached.

**EOPNOTSUPP**
   The specified protocol does not support creation of socket pairs.

**EPROTONOSUPPORT**
   The specified protocol is not supported on this machine.

CONFORMING TO
=============

POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, 4.4BSD. **socketpair**\ () first appeared in
4.2BSD. It is generally portable to/from non-BSD systems supporting
clones of the BSD socket layer (including System V variants).

NOTES
=====

On Linux, the only supported domains for this call are **AF_UNIX** (or
synonymously, **AF_LOCAL**) and **AF_TIPC** (since Linux 4.12).

Since Linux 2.6.27, **socketpair**\ () supports the **SOCK_NONBLOCK**
and **SOCK_CLOEXEC** flags in the *type* argument, as described in
**socket**\ (2).

POSIX.1 does not require the inclusion of *<sys/types.h>*, and this
header file is not required on Linux. However, some historical (BSD)
implementations required this header file, and portable applications are
probably wise to include it.
