NAME
====

\_syscall - invoking a system call without library support (OBSOLETE)

SYNOPSIS
========

**#include <linux/unistd.h>**

A \_syscall macro

desired system call

DESCRIPTION
===========

The important thing to know about a system call is its prototype. You
need to know how many arguments, their types, and the function return
type. There are seven macros that make the actual call into the system
easier. They have the form:

::

   _syscallX(type,name,type1,arg1,type2,arg2,...)

where

   *X* is 0â€“6, which are the number of arguments taken by the system
   call

   *type* is the return type of the system call

   *name* is the name of the system call

   *typeN* is the Nth argument's type

   *argN* is the name of the Nth argument

These macros create a function called *name* with the arguments you
specify. Once you include the \_syscall() in your source file, you call
the system call by *name*.

FILES
=====

*/usr/include/linux/unistd.h*

CONFORMING TO
=============

The use of these macros is Linux-specific, and deprecated.

NOTES
=====

Starting around kernel 2.6.18, the \_syscall macros were removed from
header files supplied to user space. Use **syscall**\ (2) instead. (Some
architectures, notably ia64, never provided the \_syscall macros; on
those architectures, **syscall**\ (2) was always required.)

The \_syscall() macros *do not* produce a prototype. You may have to
create one, especially for C++ users.

System calls are not required to return only positive or negative error
codes. You need to read the source to be sure how it will return errors.
Usually, it is the negative of a standard error code, for example,
-*EPERM*. The \_syscall() macros will return the result *r* of the
system call when *r* is nonnegative, but will return -1 and set the
variable *errno* to -*r* when *r* is negative. For the error codes, see
**errno**\ (3).

When defining a system call, the argument types *must* be passed
by-value or by-pointer (for aggregates like structs).

EXAMPLES
========

::

   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <stdlib.h>
   #include <errno.h>
   #include <linux/unistd.h>       /* for _syscallX macros/related stuff */
   #include <linux/kernel.h>       /* for struct sysinfo */

   _syscall1(int, sysinfo, struct sysinfo *, info);

   int
   main(void)
   {
       struct sysinfo s_info;
       int error;

       error = sysinfo(&s_info);
       printf("code error = %d\n", error);
       printf("Uptime = %lds\nLoad: 1 min %lu / 5 min %lu / 15 min %lu\n"
              "RAM: total %lu / free %lu / shared %lu\n"
              "Memory in buffers = %lu\nSwap: total %lu / free %lu\n"
              "Number of processes = %d\n",
              s_info.uptime, s_info.loads[0],
              s_info.loads[1], s_info.loads[2],
              s_info.totalram, s_info.freeram,
              s_info.sharedram, s_info.bufferram,
              s_info.totalswap, s_info.freeswap,
              s_info.procs);
       exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
   }

Sample output
-------------

::

   code error = 0
   uptime = 502034s
   Load: 1 min 13376 / 5 min 5504 / 15 min 1152
   RAM: total 15343616 / free 827392 / shared 8237056
   Memory in buffers = 5066752
   Swap: total 27881472 / free 24698880
   Number of processes = 40
