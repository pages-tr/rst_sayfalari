DESCRIPTION
===========

The function **clock_getres**\ () finds the resolution (precision) of
the specified clock *clockid*, and, if *res* is non-NULL, stores it in
the *struct timespec* pointed to by *res*. The resolution of clocks
depends on the implementation and cannot be configured by a particular
process. If the time value pointed to by the argument *tp* of
**clock_settime**\ () is not a multiple of *res*, then it is truncated
to a multiple of *res*.

The functions **clock_gettime**\ () and **clock_settime**\ () retrieve
and set the time of the specified clock *clockid*.

The *res* and *tp* arguments are *timespec* structures, as specified in
*<time.h>*:

::

   struct timespec {
       time_t   tv_sec;        /* seconds */
       long     tv_nsec;       /* nanoseconds */
   };

The *clockid* argument is the identifier of the particular clock on
which to act. A clock may be system-wide and hence visible for all
processes, or per-process if it measures time only within a single
process.

All implementations support the system-wide real-time clock, which is
identified by **CLOCK_REALTIME**. Its time represents seconds and
nanoseconds since the Epoch. When its time is changed, timers for a
relative interval are unaffected, but timers for an absolute point in
time are affected.

More clocks may be implemented. The interpretation of the corresponding
time values and the effect on timers is unspecified.

Sufficiently recent versions of glibc and the Linux kernel support the
following clocks:

**CLOCK_REALTIME**
   A settable system-wide clock that measures real (i.e., wall-clock)
   time. Setting this clock requires appropriate privileges. This clock
   is affected by discontinuous jumps in the system time (e.g., if the
   system administrator manually changes the clock), and by the
   incremental adjustments performed by **adjtime**\ (3) and NTP.

**CLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM** (since Linux 3.0; Linux-specific)
   Like **CLOCK_REALTIME**, but not settable. See **timer_create**\ (2)
   for further details.

**CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE** (since Linux 2.6.32; Linux-specific)
   A faster but less precise version of **CLOCK_REALTIME**. This clock
   is not settable. Use when you need very fast, but not fine-grained
   timestamps. Requires per-architecture support, and probably also
   architecture support for this flag in the **vdso**\ (7).

**CLOCK_TAI** (since Linux 3.10; Linux-specific)
   A nonsettable system-wide clock derived from wall-clock time but
   ignoring leap seconds. This clock does not experience discontinuities
   and backwards jumps caused by NTP inserting leap seconds as
   **CLOCK_REALTIME** does.

   The acronym TAI refers to International Atomic Time.

**CLOCK_MONOTONIC**
   A nonsettable system-wide clock that represents monotonic time
   since—as described by POSIX—"some unspecified point in the past". On
   Linux, that point corresponds to the number of seconds that the
   system has been running since it was booted.

   The **CLOCK_MONOTONIC** clock is not affected by discontinuous jumps
   in the system time (e.g., if the system administrator manually
   changes the clock), but is affected by the incremental adjustments
   performed by **adjtime**\ (3) and NTP. This clock does not count time
   that the system is suspended. All **CLOCK_MONOTONIC** variants
   guarantee that the time returned by consecutive calls will not go
   backwards, but successive calls may—depending on the
   architecture—return identical (not-increased) time values.

**CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE** (since Linux 2.6.32; Linux-specific)
   A faster but less precise version of **CLOCK_MONOTONIC**. Use when
   you need very fast, but not fine-grained timestamps. Requires
   per-architecture support, and probably also architecture support for
   this flag in the **vdso**\ (7).

**CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW** (since Linux 2.6.28; Linux-specific)
   Similar to **CLOCK_MONOTONIC**, but provides access to a raw
   hardware-based time that is not subject to NTP adjustments or the
   incremental adjustments performed by **adjtime**\ (3). This clock
   does not count time that the system is suspended.

**CLOCK_BOOTTIME** (since Linux 2.6.39; Linux-specific)
   A nonsettable system-wide clock that is identical to
   **CLOCK_MONOTONIC**, except that it also includes any time that the
   system is suspended. This allows applications to get a suspend-aware
   monotonic clock without having to deal with the complications of
   **CLOCK_REALTIME**, which may have discontinuities if the time is
   changed using **settimeofday**\ (2) or similar.

**CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM** (since Linux 3.0; Linux-specific)
   Like **CLOCK_BOOTTIME**. See **timer_create**\ (2) for further
   details.

**CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID** (since Linux 2.6.12)
   This is a clock that measures CPU time consumed by this process
   (i.e., CPU time consumed by all threads in the process). On Linux,
   this clock is not settable.

**CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID** (since Linux 2.6.12)
   This is a clock that measures CPU time consumed by this thread. On
   Linux, this clock is not settable.

Linux also implements dynamic clock instances as described below.

Dynamic clocks
--------------

In addition to the hard-coded System-V style clock IDs described above,
Linux also supports POSIX clock operations on certain character devices.
Such devices are called "dynamic" clocks, and are supported since Linux
2.6.39.

Using the appropriate macros, open file descriptors may be converted
into clock IDs and passed to **clock_gettime**\ (),
**clock_settime**\ (), and **clock_adjtime**\ (2). The following example
shows how to convert a file descriptor into a dynamic clock ID.

::

   #define CLOCKFD 3
   #define FD_TO_CLOCKID(fd)   ((~(clockid_t) (fd) << 3) | CLOCKFD)
   #define CLOCKID_TO_FD(clk)  ((unsigned int) ~((clk) >> 3))

   struct timeval tv;
   clockid_t clkid;
   int fd;

   fd = open("/dev/ptp0", O_RDWR);
   clkid = FD_TO_CLOCKID(fd);
   clock_gettime(clkid, &tv);

RETURN VALUE
============

**clock_gettime**\ (), **clock_settime**\ (), and **clock_getres**\ ()
return 0 for success, or -1 for failure (in which case *errno* is set
appropriately).

ERRORS
======

**EFAULT**
   *tp* points outside the accessible address space.

**EINVAL**
   The *clockid* specified is invalid for one of two reasons. Either the
   System-V style hard coded positive value is out of range, or the
   dynamic clock ID does not refer to a valid instance of a clock
   object.

**EINVAL**
   (**clock_settime**\ ()): *tp.tv_sec* is negative or *tp.tv_nsec* is
   outside the range [0..999,999,999].

**EINVAL**
   The *clockid* specified in a call to **clock_settime**\ () is not a
   settable clock.

**ENOTSUP**
   The operation is not supported by the dynamic POSIX clock device
   specified.

**EINVAL** (since Linux 4.3)
   A call to **clock_settime**\ () with a *clockid* of
   **CLOCK_REALTIME** attempted to set the time to a value less than the
   current value of the **CLOCK_MONOTONIC** clock.

**ENODEV**
   The hot-pluggable device (like USB for example) represented by a
   dynamic *clk_id* has disappeared after its character device was
   opened.

**EPERM**
   **clock_settime**\ () does not have permission to set the clock
   indicated.

**EACCES**
   **clock_settime**\ () does not have write permission for the dynamic
   POSIX clock device indicated.

VERSIONS
========

These system calls first appeared in Linux 2.6.

CONFORMING TO
=============

POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SUSv2.

On POSIX systems on which these functions are available, the symbol
**\_POSIX_TIMERS** is defined in *<unistd.h>* to a value greater than 0.
The symbols **\_POSIX_MONOTONIC_CLOCK**, **\_POSIX_CPUTIME**,
**\_POSIX_THREAD_CPUTIME** indicate that **CLOCK_MONOTONIC**,
**CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID**, **CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID** are available.
(See also **sysconf**\ (3).)

NOTES
=====

POSIX.1 specifies the following:

   Setting the value of the **CLOCK_REALTIME** clock via
   **clock_settime**\ () shall have no effect on threads that are
   blocked waiting for a relative time service based upon this clock,
   including the **nanosleep**\ () function; nor on the expiration of
   relative timers based upon this clock. Consequently, these time
   services shall expire when the requested relative interval elapses,
   independently of the new or old value of the clock.

According to POSIX.1-2001, a process with "appropriate privileges" may
set the **CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID** and **CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID**
clocks using **clock_settime**\ (). On Linux, these clocks are not
settable (i.e., no process has "appropriate privileges").

C library/kernel differences
----------------------------

On some architectures, an implementation of **clock_gettime**\ () is
provided in the **vdso**\ (7).

Historical note for SMP systems
-------------------------------

Before Linux added kernel support for **CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID** and
**CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID**, glibc implemented these clocks on many
platforms using timer registers from the CPUs (TSC on i386, AR.ITC on
Itanium). These registers may differ between CPUs and as a consequence
these clocks may return **bogus results** if a process is migrated to
another CPU.

If the CPUs in an SMP system have different clock sources, then there is
no way to maintain a correlation between the timer registers since each
CPU will run at a slightly different frequency. If that is the case,
then *clock_getcpuclockid(0)* will return **ENOENT** to signify this
condition. The two clocks will then be useful only if it can be ensured
that a process stays on a certain CPU.

The processors in an SMP system do not start all at exactly the same
time and therefore the timer registers are typically running at an
offset. Some architectures include code that attempts to limit these
offsets on bootup. However, the code cannot guarantee to accurately tune
the offsets. Glibc contains no provisions to deal with these offsets
(unlike the Linux Kernel). Typically these offsets are small and
therefore the effects may be negligible in most cases.

Since glibc 2.4, the wrapper functions for the system calls described in
this page avoid the abovementioned problems by employing the kernel
implementation of **CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID** and
**CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID**, on systems that provide such an
implementation (i.e., Linux 2.6.12 and later).

EXAMPLES
========

The program below demonstrates the use of **clock_gettime**\ () and
**clock_getres**\ () with various clocks. This is an example of what we
might see when running the program:

::

   $ ./clock_times x
   CLOCK_REALTIME : 1585985459.446 (18356 days +  7h 30m 59s)
        resolution:          0.000000001
   CLOCK_TAI      : 1585985496.447 (18356 days +  7h 31m 36s)
        resolution:          0.000000001
   CLOCK_MONOTONIC:      52395.722 (14h 33m 15s)
        resolution:          0.000000001
   CLOCK_BOOTTIME :      72691.019 (20h 11m 31s)
        resolution:          0.000000001
